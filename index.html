    <h1>Welcome to KC AI Lab</h1>

<h2>What is the experience that a client can expect?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Agile methodology at the core while in development. A suitable project management model is picked that is most effective for the slated business objectives of the project.</li>
<li>Checkpoints with the client take place throughout the project life in a frequency determined by the client (every 2-4 weeks is typical)</li>
<li>Frequent discussions take place throughout the project to refine the use-case and align the outcomes with the new client actions that they will take because of the project.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What are the outcomes a client can expect?</h2>
<ul>
<li>A full report on the original project goals and which are met, and if not met a detailed explanation why the original goal was impossible and what can be done to make it possible in the future.</li>
<li>Clear and defined actions for the client to take that reflect the original project goals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What makes the KC AI Lab successful in managing a project?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The development of each project is led by an experienced machine learning engineer.</li>
<li>Process standards have been built and refined through multiple projects and are followed closely to deliver consistent outcomes.</li>
<li>We work together as a cohesive group on each project and combine ideas to give the most robust solution possible. We integrate closely via powerful collaboration tools like Slack to stay on top of things & be more productive. </li>
<li>Data scientists constantly share ideas for improvements and optimizations which are key for success while working on machine learning modules. </li>
</ul>

<h2>How we incorporated these principles into the KSU Malaria Project?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The KSU Malaria Research project currently underway is a great example of how we as an organization follow processes and standards during the development phase of a project while also combine ideas from multiple data scientists.</li>
<li>An overview of the project background and how we are executing the project in all these aspects is described below. </li>
</ul>
